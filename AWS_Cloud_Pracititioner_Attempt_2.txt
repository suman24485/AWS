13) Stephen is having issues tracking how much compute capacity his application is using. Ideally, he wants to track and have alarms for when CPU utilization goes over 70%. What should Stephen do to accomplish this?

Correct

Correct answer
Configure a CloudWatch alarm with an alarm threshold set to trigger when CPU utilization is greater than 70%.

Explanation
The answer is to configure a CloudWatch alarm with an alarm threshold set to trigger when CPU utilization is greater than 70%. This will display the alarm in "alarm" state when CPU utilization is greater than 70%. This question has been worded very specifically with the works "goes above 70%". This disqualifies the answer that stated "great than or equal to 70%". The AWS exam will have very tricky questions like this.

14) Matt is working on a project that involves converting images format from .png to .jpg. Thousands of images have to be converted; however, time is not really an issue and continuous processing is not required. Which type of EC2 buying option would be most cost-effective for Matt to use?

Correct

Correct answer
Spot

Explanation
Spot instances offer the cheapest option of all EC2's buying options. However, spot instances should only be used when there can be interruptions in the processing jobs being conducted. This is due to the fluctuation in spot pricing. If the spot price goes above your bid price, then you will lose access to the spot instance (thus causing a stoppage in processing).

Correct

Correct answer
You are locked in to either a one- or three-year pricing commitment. , Reserved instances can be purchased as a significant discount over on-demand instances.

Explanation
Reserved instances require a one- or three-year purchase term, so you are committing to paying for that much compute capacity for that full time period. However, in exchange for the long-term commitment, you will receive a discount (of up to 75%) over using an on-demand instance (for that same time period).
